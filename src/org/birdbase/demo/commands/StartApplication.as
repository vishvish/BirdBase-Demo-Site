	/**
	 * This command is fired by the framework once the configuration is loaded and bootstrap is complete.
	 * 
	 * At this point, we have all the information to map our URLs to our views/mediators.
	 * 
	 * The example code in here is only one way to map URLs in AS3-Navigator. The integration, at time of writing,
	 * is being worked on by Eric-Paul Lecluse, and the standard way is to extend NavigatorContext.
	 * 
	 * I wanted to keep AS3-Navigator higher up in the application layers, and to dynamically map the view, mediator
	 * and URL using a little bit of reflection. I think it's tider than reams of XML. Hence the StateViewMap is
	 * manually instantiated below.
	 * 
	 * The references to ViewRecipes in the code are a way to layer multiple views in AS3-Navigator. Please refer to
	 * that library for better and more up-to-date documentation.
